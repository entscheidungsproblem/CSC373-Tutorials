# CSC373 Tutorials
 While working as a teaching assistant for CSC373 - Intro to Algorithms, I created the material for all of the Teaching Assistants (including myself) to present and test the students with during tutorials. I wrote and distribute the attached questions to practice with students to help them understand each weeks content. For the last weeks tutorial, I made a Jeopardy game to review the content from the semester. All tutorials (including Jeopardy) were created in Latex, which was available to the students, to encourage them to use it for the assignments.
 
 Note that some sections have been removed, in particular assignment review answers.
