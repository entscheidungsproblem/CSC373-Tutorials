The game contains questions from previous exams, problem sets and various queston online.

The source code is included if there are any issues. The game is a bit buggy. To answer a question, click answer, done then next to go to the home. Sometimes after the first question the home page won't reload to hide the previously picked button. Try entering/exiting fullscreen to fix this. Some answers are included and are some are rough so don't rely on them heavily.

If you want to use a buzzer, I would suggest following [this guide](https://whsipadpilot.wordpress.com/2012/09/28/using-googleforms-for-a-simple-classroom-buzzer/) to create a buzzer using Google Forms.
