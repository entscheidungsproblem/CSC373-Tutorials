The game contains questions from previous exams, problem sets and various queston online.

The source code is included if there are any issues. The game is a bit buggy. To answer a question, click answer, done then next to go to the home. Sometimes after the first question the home page won't reload to hide the previously picked button. Try entering/exiting fullscreen to fix this. Some answers are included and are some are rough so don't rely on them heavily.
